Prediction of Insurance Charges:

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for performing an exploratory data analysis and building a predictive model on the Prediction of Insurance Charges dataset using Python. The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate healthcare charges based on individual characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, and smoking status.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from Kaggle datasets. The URL is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/prediction-of-insurance-charges-using-age-gender.

Code and Libraries Used:

This project uses Python and various libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and Plotly.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

The exploratory data analysis in this project involves performing descriptive statistics, creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, and examining the relationships between variables.

Model Building:

This project uses various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, Ridge Regression and Grid search to develop the predictive model, and evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error, and mean squared error.

Notebook and Repository Contents:

The notebook is well-documented and provides a step-by-step guide to the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building stages. The repository also includes the dataset used in the analysis, a README file, a pdf of the notebook where all the plots are visible because in the collab notebook scatter and box plots are not visible and a .gitignore file.

Conclusion:

Overall, this exploratory data analysis of the insurance dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to healthcare charges and may be useful in informing healthcare policy and decision-making.
